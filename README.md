## Introduction

GeneExpressPy is a Python package designed for computational biologists and genetic engineers working with gene expression modulation. This package facilitates the detection of internal start codons (TIS) within a gene sequence and allows for tuning gene expression by replacing the TIS with a sequence that minimizes expression efficiency.

## Features

- Detection of internal start codons within gene sequences.
- Identification of the TIS position and associated efficiency score.
- Substitution of the TIS sequence with the lowest possible efficiency.
- Optimized gene expression modulation for experimental and synthetic biology applications.

## Installation

GeneTuner can be installed via pip using the following command:

```shell
pip install GeneExpressPy
```
